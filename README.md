LegendaryClient
===============

Beautiful, fully-featured League of Legends client.

Still under heavy development! Lots of things don't work or don't look good...

Prerequisites
=============

Currently you must have an up-to-date installation of League of Legends. It will not patch to the latest version, but it will retrieve your current data.
