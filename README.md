LegendaryClient
===============

Beautiful, fully-featured League of Legends client based off https://github.com/Snowl/ClientOfLegends2

How to compile
===========

** You require Net 4.5 to compile this! **

First, import the DLL's found in /DLLS. This includes sqlite, awesomium and PVPNetConnect.

Next, compile it. It will crash at this point. This will be fixed once Kyoku is integrated, since required files aren't downloaded/copied on first run at the moment.

* Find your installation of League of Legends (C:\Riot Games\League of Legends) and copy *"gameStats_en_US.sqlite" to the /bin folder of LegendaryClient. 

* Next, create a folder called Assets.

* Next, find your League of Legends installation folder and navigate to *"RADS\projects\lol_air_client\releases\0.0.1.53\deploy\assets\images"*. Copy the champions folder into your Assets folder. 

* Finally, create a folder in Assets called profileImages, and add an image called 137.jpg in there.

LegendaryClient should work once this is complete. Your folder should look like this: http://i.imgur.com/MXMQG8Y.png
